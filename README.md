# TensorFlow Image Tutorial

This repository contains examples neural network implementations in TensorFlow for image classification.
The code structure aims at showing that it is easy to modify the structure of a neural network without impacting the rest of the code.

The examples run with TensorFlow 1.0, with the Python API.

## Run the code
```
cd tensorflow_image_tutorial/train directory
```
Choose the model you want and run the corresponding Python file.

## See results in TensorBoard
